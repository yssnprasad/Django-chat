## Overview of the Chat App

The main focus of this chat application is to enable users chat with one another, therefore I didn't add an authentication system, users are created and logged-in from the Django admin. <br><br> Before you access the index page of this application, a user must be logged-in, else there will be an AnonymousUserError from Django. <br><br>Remember creating of users, profiles and friends all done in the Django admin.
